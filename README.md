# Statistics Report on Fuel Consumption
Report for the course in Statistics @ITHS in 2024. 
It's a Jupyter Notebook file, exploring two research questions for a given dataset, using fundamental statistical analysis.

## Introduction
I chose to explore the auto-mpg dataset consisting of 398 cars produced between 1970-1982, and collected by the *American Statistical Association* in 1983. Given that the dataset is American, it might well be biased and not representative of all European and Japanese cars available on the market in Europe and Japan at the time. We will assume that it's fairly representative, but keep the possible bias in mind. 

I will pursue two research questions, the first a hypothesis test, and the second a linear regression analysis including prediction:
1. **Can we, with 99% certainty, say that there was a difference in fuel comsumption between American, European, and Japanese cars** in the years 1970-1982.
2. **Can we to a sufficient degree (80%) predict a car's fuel consumption based on its weight and horse powers?**
